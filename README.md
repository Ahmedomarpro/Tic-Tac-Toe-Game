## Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
# INFO

create an offline 2 player Tic Tac Toe game.
We will code the whole game logic, 
count player points, 
add a reset functionality and handle orientation changes, 
so we don't lose our game state when we rotate the device.

In part 1 we will create the layout by creating 9 buttons within nested
LinearLayouts and we will even them out over the screen by adding the layout_weight attribute. 
Our player points and reset button will be in a RelativeLayout.


### Lets play Tic Tac Toe!!!

Enter the coordinates for where you want to move,
Ex: '0' would move you to the 1st column, 1st row,
